## Our Product

DEX3 is a highly tactile game controller cube designed to improve hand strength, speed, dexterity and coordination in people with disorders such as dyspraxia, cerebral palsy, and arthritis. 

Each face of the cube presents different modes of motion to control simple game interfaces, such as our developed games: ‘Jump and Slide’ and ‘A-maze’, with different levels available to encourage progress and track improvement. 

Our product aims to fill a gap in the market for young adults needing engaging and rewarding rehabilitation devices.

## Future Plans
